## Features of the Plinko Live game demo

- **Classic Plinko board with visible pegs**  
  The ball drops row by row and randomly moves left or right, creating a realistic Plinko path through the peg grid.

- **Multiple risk levels**  
  Switch between **low**, **medium** and **high** risk to change the multiplier layout:
  - low risk: smoother multipliers focused around the middle slots;  
  - medium risk: more pronounced edges with higher payouts;  
  - high risk: very volatile edge multipliers with frequent low returns.

- **Auto play mode**  
  Launch auto mode and let the game drop balls one by one until you stop or your demo balance runs out. This makes it easy to observe how your bankroll behaves over many rounds.

- **Virtual balance and bet controls**  
  - Adjustable bet amount before each drop;  
  - Risk selector directly above the board;  
  - Balance label that shows how much you would hypothetically win or lose over time.

- **Mobile-friendly Plinko layout**  
  The **Plinko board**, controls and text sections adapt to smaller screen sizes, so the demo is usable on phones and tablets.

- **Pure front-end Plinko project**  
  The **free Plinko game** is implemented as a static HTML/JS app with no backend, no accounts and no tracking.

## Use cases: why this Plinko simulator is useful

- **Strategy and variance practice**  
  Run short auto sessions on each risk level and see how quickly your demo bankroll grows or shrinks. This helps illustrate how risk profiles affect long-term outcomes, even in a simple Plinko-style game.

- **Education and responsible gambling content**  
  Embed the **Plinko game demo** next to reviews or guides to show:
  - how often edge multipliers really hit;  
  - why long losing streaks are normal in high-risk setups;  
  - how bankroll management changes the experience.

- **Code reference for Plinko-style games**  
  The repository is a compact example of a **Plinko game implemented in JavaScript**. It’s useful if you want to:
  - add a Plinko demo to a website as an interactive widget;  
  - prototype your own Plinko-inspired mini game;  
  - study how to connect binomial-style outcomes with a visual board and UI state.
