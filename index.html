      <div class="container">
        <h2>What is Plinko and how does this online version work?</h2>
        <p>
          Plinko is a simple game where a ball drops from the top of a board filled with pegs.
          On every row the ball randomly moves left or right, eventually landing in one of the
          slots with different multipliers. Central slots usually hit more often, while edge
          slots can have much higher payouts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Plinko Live is a lightweight browser version of this idea. The game runs entirely in
          HTML, CSS and JavaScript and does not require registration, downloads or plugins.
          You can open it in a desktop or mobile browser and experiment with different risk
          levels and bet sizes.

    <!-- HOW TO PLAY -->

      <div class="container">
        <h2>How to play Plinko Live online</h2>
        <p>
          You only need a browser to start playing. Follow these simple steps:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Set your bet amount.</strong> Enter the stake in the field above the board.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Choose a risk level.</strong>
            Low risk keeps multipliers closer together, while high risk adds big edge values but
            more low outcomes overall.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Drop a single ball.</strong> Click <em>“Drop ball”</em> to launch one round and
            see where it lands.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Use auto play (optional).</strong> Click <em>“Start auto”</em> to keep dropping
            balls automatically one by one until you stop or run out of balance.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Adjust and experiment.</strong> Change risk and bet size to see how your
            long-term result is affected.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The balance displayed above the board helps you track how much you would hypothetically
          gain or lose over a series of rounds. It is only a simulation and does not involve
          real-money transactions.

      <div class="container">
        <h2>Basic Plinko strategies and tips</h2>
        <p>
          Plinko is still a random game, but a few simple ideas make testing strategies more
          meaningful:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Think in series, not single spins.</strong> Any one drop can hit an edge slot,
            but long-term results are shaped by the risk level you use.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Use smaller bets for high risk.</strong> High risk layouts have attractive
            multipliers on the sides, but most hits still land near the middle.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Compare risk levels.</strong> Run a short auto session on each risk level to
            see how quickly the balance goes up or down.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Set a virtual loss limit.</strong> Even in a demo it is useful to decide in
            advance when you want to stop.
          </li>
        </ul>

          <article class="faq-item">
            <h3>Is this Plinko game free to play?</h3>
            <p>
              Yes. Plinko Live runs entirely in your browser and is free to use. The balance and
              bets you see on screen are virtual and used only for simulation.
            </p>

          <article class="faq-item">
            <h3>Do I need to register or create an account?</h3>
            <p>
              No registration or sign-up is required. Open the page, set your bet and start dropping
              balls right away.
            </p>
          </article>

          <article class="faq-item">
            <h3>How are the multipliers and outcomes calculated?</h3>
            <p>
              The ball moves row by row through a grid of pegs. On every row it randomly goes left
              or right, which produces a binomial-like distribution — central slots are more likely
              than edge slots. Multipliers depend on the chosen risk level.
            </p>

          <article class="faq-item">
            <h3>Does this game use real-money gambling mechanics?</h3>
            <p>
              No. This is a standalone demo. It does not connect to any casino, does not accept
              deposits and does not pay out winnings. It is intended for educational and
              entertainment use only.

          <article class="faq-item">
            <h3>Can I use this Plinko board in my own project?</h3>

              and adapt the idea for your own experiments or learning projects.
